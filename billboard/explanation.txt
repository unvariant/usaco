Given two rectangles, calculate how much of the two rectangles are not covered by a third rectangle.
The first two rectangles are guaranteed to not intersect.

uncovered = area(first) + area(second) - intersect(first, third) - intersect(second, third);

PROBLEM with intersect function was that if the two rectangles did not intersect it would
an incorrect answer.
